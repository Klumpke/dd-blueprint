# Dwains Lovelace Dashboard Community Blueprints

This is a development repository. For the official repository please visit: [github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-dashboard-blueprints](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-dashboard-blueprints)


With Dwains Dashboard Blueprints you can extend the dashboard functionality with lovelace cards without changing any of the dashboard cores code. This way you can always update to the latest version without problems but still add your own pages(views) or cards.

There are 2 types of blueprints currently available:

### Card Blueprint
With the **Card blueprints** you can add custom pre-made/pre-configured lovelace cards to Dwains Dashboard.

### Page Blueprint
With **Page blueprints** you can still add own pages to Dwains Dashboard, you even can put them in the main navbar! Letâ€™s say you want a page with some statistics or just an extra page with some cards. Then more page blueprints is the way to go.
